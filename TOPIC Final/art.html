            <span class="outline">the human face and figure</span><span class="merge"> and by the question how to trans</span><span class="iitalic">form a portrait of a </span> <br>

            <p><span class="merge">The works of Martin C. He</span><span class="outline">rbst invite the viewer to observe </span><span class="iitalic">them from multiple <br></span>
            <span class="merge">perspectives, as we imme</span><span class="outline">diately understand that the art pi</span><span class="iitalic">eces work on various </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">levels. They are curious, p</span><span class="outline">olyvalent as well as visually and in</span><span class="iitalic">tellectually appealing, </span><br>
            <span class="merge">similar to mercury, this fas</span><span class="outline">cinating element that has inspire</span><span class="iitalic">d thinkers, artists and </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">alchemists since the Antiq</span><span class="outline">uity. However, it is not only the el</span><span class="iitalic">egant and pleasing <br></span>
            <span class="merge">appearance of mercury, th</span><span class="outline">e bright silver colour that bears i</span><span class="iitalic">mportant similarities with </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">the artist's work, but also </span><span class="outline">another feature: its constant mov</span><span class="iitalic">ement. Also called </span><br>
            <span class="merge">quicksilver, a sense of con</span><span class="outline">tinuous movement is attributed t</span><span class="iitalic">o the shiny and liquid </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">metal that can be seen in </span><span class="outline">parallel with the way that Martin </span><span class="iitalic">C. Herbst's art pieces </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">oscillate between periods,</span><span class="outline"> genres and media. Therefore, m</span><span class="iitalic">ercury here refers to not </span><br>
            <span class="merge">merely the visual features,</span><span class="outline"> but also to the works' ability to a</span><span class="iitalic">ct as messengers </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">(Mercurius) between other</span><span class="outline"> artworks, masters, ages, traditio</span><span class="iitalic">ns, forms, media and </span><br>
            <span class="merge">aesthetic experiences.</span></p>
            <p><span class="merge">At first sight it is the pure </span><span class="outline">beauty and the meticulous execut</span><span class="iitalic">ion that appears, <br></span>
            <span class="merge">pleasing our senses, and l</span><span class="outline">etting the viewer enjoy the clear </span><span class="iitalic">and stainless objects. </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">However, the artist does n</span><span class="outline">ot stop at this primary aesthetic </span><span class="iitalic">appeal, but includes </span><br>
            <span class="merge">multi-layered art historical</span><span class="outline"> references that stimulate the vie</span><span class="iitalic">wer to examine the </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">relationship between the p</span><span class="outline">resent contemporary work and t</span><span class="iitalic">hat of the forerunners </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">from older periods. Hence</span><span class="outline">, Martin C. Herbst opens a contin</span><span class="iitalic">uous and inspiring </span><br>
            <span class="merge">discussion between art pie</span><span class="outline">ces, traditions, artist and public. </span><span class="iitalic">By viewing the art </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">objects, the observer can </span><span class="outline">arrive at critical and noteworthy t</span><span class="iitalic">heoretical considerations <br></span>
            <span class="merge">on issues such as the bec</span><span class="outline">oming of an artwork, on the esse</span><span class="iitalic">nce of an art piece, on the </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">problem of what distinguis</span><span class="outline">hes a copy from a reference, and</span><span class="iitalic"> on the difference </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">between direct quotation </span><span class="outline">and inspiration.</span></p></div>
