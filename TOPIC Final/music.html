            <span class="outline">Club Band on May 26, 196</span><span class="merge">7 in the UK and on June 2 in the </span><span class="iitalic">US. One of the signature </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">tracks on the album was J</span><span class="merge">ohn Lennon's magisterial “A Day i</span><span class="iitalic">n the Life”. Musically </span><br>
            <span class="outline">brilliant and structurally mi</span><span class="merge">nd blowing, no one had heard an</span><span class="iitalic">ything like it before. </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">Actually, it's a wonder any</span><span class="merge">one heard it all because it present</span><span class="iitalic">ed a number of unique <br></span>
            <span class="outline">recording challenges acco</span><span class="merge">rding to Geoff Emerick, the lead s</span><span class="iitalic">ound engineer on</span> <br>

            <p><span class="outline">With today's digital record</span><span class="merge">ing technology, every sound bein</span><span class="iitalic">g recorded can reside on </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">its own track and can be m</span><span class="merge">anipulated at will as it's fed into t</span><span class="iitalic">he mix. This gives the </span><br>
            <span class="outline">recording engineers a lot </span><span class="merge">of flexibility in adding, subtracting</span><span class="iitalic">, and modifying the </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">elements of a song.</span></p>
            <p><span class="outline">“A Day in the Life”, like eve</span><span class="merge">rything else on Sgt. Pepper's, wa</span><span class="iitalic">s recorded on four-track </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">tape machines which mea</span><span class="merge">ns that flexibility was limited as al</span><span class="iitalic">l of the sounds in the </span><br>
            <span class="outline">song had to be present on</span><span class="merge"> those four tracks. The orchestral</span><span class="iitalic"> crescendo that occurs </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">twice in the song and the </span><span class="merge">extraordinary sustained piano ch</span><span class="iitalic">ord at the end turned </span><br>
            <span class="outline">recording “A Day in the Lif</span><span class="merge">e”into an epic sound engineering </span><span class="iitalic">task. Emerick recounts </span> <br>

            <p><span class="merge">The recording process for </span><span class="outline">“A Day in the Life” began with a f</span><span class="iitalic">ortuitous accident. The </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">limitations of four-track re</span><span class="outline">cording required that the instrum</span><span class="iitalic">ental backing track for </span><br>
            <span class="merge">the song be recorded in o</span><span class="outline">ne go from start to finish. Normall</span><span class="iitalic">y, the Beatles worked out </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">an entire song before they</span><span class="outline"> laid down the backing track. How</span><span class="iitalic">ever, the rest of the <br></span>
            <span class="merge">studio that they wanted to</span><span class="outline"> lay down the backing track imm</span><span class="iitalic">ediately. This presented a </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">problem because there wa</span><span class="outline">s a 24-bar hole in the middle of t</span><span class="iitalic">he song that they didn't </span><br>
            <span class="merge">know how they were going</span><span class="outline"> to fill.</span><br></p>
            <p><span class="merge">They decided to go ahead</span><span class="outline"> anyway, leave the 24 bars blank,</span><span class="iitalic"> and record something in <br></span>
            <span class="merge">the hole on the tape later. </span><span class="outline">Mal Evans, one of the Beatles' ro</span><span class="iitalic">adies, was tasked with </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">counting off the 24 bars d</span><span class="outline">uring the recording so the musici</span><span class="iitalic">ans could concentrate on </span><br>
            <span class="merge">what they were going to p</span><span class="outline">lay when the gap ended. Evans s</span><span class="iitalic">et an alarm clock off at </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">the start of the 24th bar to</span><span class="outline"> alert the Beatles that it was alm</span><span class="iitalic">ost time to resume <br></span>
            <span class="merge">playing. The tape picked u</span><span class="outline">p the alarm and Emerick couldn't</span><span class="iitalic"> find a way to eliminate it </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">from the mix.</span></p></div>

            <p><span class="iitalic">As luck would have it, the </span><span class="merge">alarm clock didn't turn out to be a</span><span class="merge"> problem. Paul <br></span>
            <span class="iitalic">McCartney had a song sni</span><span class="merge">ppet that he thought might work </span><span class="merge">with the theme of “A Day </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">in the Life”. The snippet w</span><span class="merge">as planned to follow the 24-bar g</span><span class="merge">ap. His segment begins </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">with the lines “Woke up/ G</span><span class="merge">ot out of bed/ Dragged a comb a</span><span class="merge">cross my head”. Although </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">he wasn't thinking about it</span><span class="merge"> at the time, McCartney's “Woke </span><span class="merge">up” lyric changed Mal <br></span>
            <span class="iitalic">Evans' alarm clock from a </span><span class="merge">sound engineering problem to wh</span><span class="merge">at may have sounded like </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">an inspired overdub.</span></span></p>
            <p><span class="iitalic">With the alarm clock issue</span><span class="merge"> solved, the band was left with th</span><span class="merge">e problem of what to do <br></span>
            <span class="iitalic">with the 24-bar hole in the</span><span class="merge"> song. Lennon suggested somet</span><span class="merge">hing that started out small </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">and grew into something h</span><span class="merge">uge. McCartney liked that idea a</span><span class="merge">nd suggested doing it </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">with a full orchestra. Geor</span><span class="merge">ge Martin, Sgt. Pepper's producer,</span><span class="merge"> said there was no way </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">EMI, the company that ow</span><span class="merge">ned the Abbey Road studio where</span><span class="merge">t the album was being </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">made, would pay for a full </span><span class="merge">orchestra to record 24 bars of mu</span><span class="merge">sic. Ringo solved the </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">problem by suggesting the</span><span class="merge">y hire half an orchestra and have</span><span class="merge"> them play it twice.</span> <br></p></div>
