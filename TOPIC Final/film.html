            <p><span class="outline">The expressionistic techni</span><span class="merge">ques of German cinema were det</span><span class="iitalic">ermined by their <br></span>
            <span class="outline">historical time period. Exp</span><span class="merge">ressionism had originated in paint</span><span class="iitalic">ing and theater, but had </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">made its way into cinema </span><span class="merge">during the 1920s and 1930s, as a </span><span class="iitalic">reaction against realism. </span><br>
            <span class="outline">This was a direct reaction </span><span class="merge">to the aftermath of World War I. T</span><span class="iitalic">he excessive visual style </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">of these films were an esc</span><span class="merge">ape or break from reality. In many</span><span class="iitalic"> instances, we can see <br></span>
            <span class="outline">how, in these films, reality </span><span class="merge">has lost its basis.</span></p>
            <p><span class="outline">The stylistic techniques an</span><span class="merge">d formal qualities of German Exp</span><span class="iitalic">ressionism films include </span><br>
            <span class="outline">the exploration of themes </span><span class="merge">of paranoia, fear, and schizophre</span><span class="iitalic">nia through mise-en-</span> <br>
            <span class="outline">sc√®ne, cinematography an</span><span class="merge">d lighting. F. W. Murnau's Nosfera</span><span class="iitalic">tu (1922) and The Last </span><br>
            <span class="outline">Laugh (1924) and Fritz La</span><span class="merge">ng's M (1931) are films whose wor</span><span class="iitalic">lds are consumed with </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">fear and corruption. The G</span><span class="merge">erman Expressionism films of this</span><span class="iitalic"> time period were </span><br>
            <span class="outline">characterized by their exp</span><span class="merge">ressive approach in externalizing</span><span class="iitalic"> human emotion and </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">desire. These films convey</span><span class="merge">ed inner, subjective emotions an</span><span class="iitalic">d experiences through </span><br>
            <span class="outline">external, objective means.</span><span class="merge"> These emotions were visually tra</span><span class="iitalic">nslated onto the screen </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">using deliberately exagger</span><span class="merge">ated sets and dramatic lighting, e</span><span class="iitalic">mphasizing the fear and </span><br>
            <span class="outline">horror that encapsulated t</span><span class="merge">he narrative.</span>><br></p>
            <p><span class="outline">These films focus on a rea</span><span class="merge">lity that has been invaded and pla</span><span class="iitalic">gued by the irrational </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">and cynical thoughts of its</span><span class="merge"> characters, and consequently, t</span><span class="iitalic">he sets in these films </span><br>
            <span class="outline">resemble their distress. Th</span><span class="merge">ese films make use of studio sets</span><span class="iitalic">  rather than actual </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">locations, with distorted b</span><span class="merge">uildings painted on canvas backd</span><span class="iitalic">rops in a<br></span>
            <span class="outline">theatrical manner.</span></p></div>

            <p><span class="merge">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</span><span class="outline"> makes use of expressionist archi</span><span class="iitalic">tecture and expresses </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">interior reality through ext</span><span class="outline">erior means with its use of extrem</span><span class="iitalic">e distortion in its </span><br>
            <span class="merge">production design. The fil</span><span class="outline">m, as a result, presents us with a </span><span class="iitalic">dark and twisted world </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">with distorted shapes and</span><span class="outline"> angles. This expressive style pre</span><span class="iitalic">sents us with a grotesque <br></span>
            <span class="merge">worldview - buildings are </span><span class="outline"> slanted, doors and windows are u</span><span class="iitalic">nusually shaped and </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">walls and floors consist of</span><span class="outline"> schizophrenic patterns and desig</span><span class="iitalic">ns. The hallways, </span><br>
            <span class="merge">intersections, and building</span><span class="outline">s in the film are all artificial and u</span><span class="iitalic">nnatural. In addition to </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">the design of the sets, the</span><span class="outline"> excessive stylization also extend</span><span class="iitalic">s to the intertitles of the  <br></span>
            <span class="merge">film. The texture, undersc</span><span class="outline">oring of certain words and phrase</span><span class="iitalic">s, and lettering </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">emphasize a schizophreni</span><span class="outline">c state of mind.</span><br></p>
            <p><span class="merge">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</span><span class="outline"> further confines its audience in a</span><span class="iitalic"> claustrophobic setting </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">through its use of lighting.</span><span class="outline"> The surrounding space of a subje</span><span class="iitalic">ct's face in close-up is <br></span>
            <span class="merge">often darkened. This is see</span><span class="outline">n with Cesare's introduction - his</span><span class="iitalic"> gruesome appearance is </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">emphasized because the f</span><span class="outline">rame is made up of just his face. </span><span class="iitalic">The murder of Alan also </span><br>
            <span class="merge">uses harsh shadows and l</span><span class="outline">ow-key lighting as a way of heigh</span><span class="iitalic">tening the drama and <br></span>
            <span class="merge">spatially disorienting the a</span><span class="outline">udience. The audience never see</span><span class="iitalic">s the actual murder -</span> <br>
            <span class="merge">instead, we focus on a nea</span><span class="outline">rby wall on the shadows that wre</span><span class="iitalic">stle for their lives.</span><br></p></div>

            <p><span class="iitalic">The space we analyzed in </span><span class="merge">our diagram is the most private o</span><span class="merge">f spaces, Dr. Caligari's  <br></span>
            <span class="iitalic">house, in a scene where F</span><span class="merge">rancis and the doctor visit his hou</span><span class="merge">se and demand that he </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">wakes Cesare up. Dr. Calig</span><span class="merge">ari's house becomes a significant</span><span class="merge"> focal point throughout </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">the film. This is his private</span><span class="merge"> dwelling, a space where he dista</span><span class="merge">nces himself from </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">society, and where he kee</span><span class="merge">ps Cesare hidden in a coffin. In o</span><span class="merge">ur research, we noticed <br></span>
            <span class="iitalic">that the interior and exteri</span><span class="merge">or shots of his house don't match</span><span class="merge">. The width of the house </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">from the exterior appears </span><span class="merge">no more than six feet in length, w</span><span class="merge">hile the interior space </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">appears slightly wider in si</span><span class="merge">ze.</span></p>
            <p><span class="iitalic">The shape and form of Dr.</span><span class="merge"> Caligari's house essentially comm</span><span class="merge">unicates the perverse <br></span>
            <span class="iitalic">nature of his being. The ho</span><span class="merge">use is unusually small in size and</span><span class="merge"> is nothing more than a </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">single room. The interior s</span><span class="merge">pace consists of painted lines, as</span><span class="merge"> well as harsh lighting </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">from a lamp, which match</span><span class="merge">es these sharp angles on the floor</span><span class="merge"> and walls. The diagram </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">highlights these lines and </span><span class="merge">shadows and emphasizes how m</span><span class="merge">uch more claustrophobic </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">the interior space feels be</span><span class="merge">cause of them. Dr. Caligari's only </span><span class="merge">means to the outside </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">world is a warped window.</span><span class="merge"> The window's distorted shape, it</span><span class="merge">s twisted and deformed </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">frame, essentially conveys</span><span class="merge"> Dr. Caligari's point-of-view of the</span><span class="merge"> outside world.<br></span></p></div>
