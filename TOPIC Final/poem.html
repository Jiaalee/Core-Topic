                배고플 때마다 이불 속에서 똥구멍을 조이는 연습을 했다<br>

                <p>불행히도 엄마의 자궁은 1989개의 동생을 낳은 후로 늙고 닳았다<br>
                젖을 빠는 대신 우리는 자궁에 인슐린을 꽂고 매일매일 번갈아 가며 엄마 다리 사이에 사정을 했다<br>
                그때마다 개미가 들끓었다</p>
                
                <p>잘 들어 엄마<br>
                엄마는 이제 여자도 뭣도 아냐<br>
                내가 이렇게 엄마 다리 사이를 핥아도 웃지를 않잖아<br>
                봐 봐<br>
                이렇게 손가락 세 개를 꽂아도 느낄 줄 몰라 엄마는</p>

                <p>엄마를 향해 사정을 했다 다리 사이로 개미들은 끓고, 턱을 벌리고 엄마의 축 처진 살을 꼬집었다<br>
                울었다 엄마는<br>
                영등포 로터리에서 핑크색 유두를 잃어버린 소녀처럼 똥파리가 들끓는 1989명의 동생을 뜯어 먹으며</p>
                
                <p>비가 오고 줄은 끊어졌다<br>
                거미는 줄을 타고 내려간다</p>

                <p>햇빛은 사라지고 나는<br>
                다리를 모두 벌린 채 다른 가지에 집을 지었다<br>
                빗방울에도 쉽게 부서지는 집을</p>
                
                
                <p>벨벳 거미는 자살적 모성애 보호가 있는 곤충으로, 산란 후 어미가 자식들에게 자기 몸을 먹이로 내어 준다. 이는 모성의 가장 극단적인 사례로 손꼽힌다. 그리고 그 극단적 모성은 숙명이다. 자식의 미래는 어미이기 때문이다. 어느 날 할머니께서는 이것에 관한 다큐를 보고 엄마에게 욕을 하셨다. ‘거미 같은 년’이라고. 나는 그날을 기억한다. 엄마는 아이처럼 방문을 꼭 걸어 잠그고 서럽게 울었다.</p></div>

                    <p>KYUNGJIN' S HOME<br>
—A SPIDER WEB</p>

<p>Mom hated bridges <br>
and us strays she'd found under the bridge of her legs</p>

<p>Our ever-cramped cradle <br>
Every night in bed the whole family's legs got tangled <br>
Two times two is four Two four eight <br>
Fuck <br>
That day, Mom birthed 1989 siblings</p>

<p>When the sun goes away <br>
the spider climbs its web</p>

<p>Having only legs we had to live <br>
Whenever we were hungry we practiced tightening our buttholes under the covers <br>
With each breath the butthole tightens, the vagina contracts</p>

<p>What a pity Mom's womb grew old and worn after birthing 1989 siblings <br>
Instead of sucking on her teats we injected insulin into her womb and took turns every day ejaculating between her legs <br>
The ants would swarm every time</p>

<p>Listen up Mom <br>
You' re not a woman or anything anymore <br>
You don t laugh even when I lick between your legs like this <br>
Look Look <br>
You can't come even when I stick three fingers inside like this</p>

<p>I shut the door tight</p>

<p>Nineteeneightynine Nineteeneightyeight Nineteeneightyseven <br>
    Nineteeneightysix Nineteeneightyfive Nineteeneightyfour <br>
    Nineteeneightythree Nineteen, Nineteen, Nineteen</p>

<p>Teen <br>
……Teen……Spleen</p>

<p>Having only legs I <br>
had to live</p>

<p>I ejaculated at Mom The ants swarmed between her legs, opened their jaws, and pinched Mom's saggy flesh <br>
Mom cried <br>
like a girl who lost her pink nipples at Yeongdeungpo Rotary as she ripped apart and ate my 1989 siblings swarmed by blowflies</p>

<p>Rain fell and the web broke <br>
The spider climbs down the web</p>

<p>White fabric and hemp cloth Carbohydrates and chocolate <br>
Maggots and leeches Plus Dad, Dad, Dad of different seeds</p>

<p>I already knew about the abstraction of death</p>

<p>Now <br>
the only way I can talk about myself without mentioning family <br>
is by making excuses</p>

<p>“Mom always called me a bitch <br>
A mother-eating spider bitch ” †</p>

<p>The sun went away and I <br>
spreading all my legs built a home in another branch <br>
A home that even a raindrop could break</p>


<p>†/ Velvet spiders engage in matriphagy, or suicidal maternal care. After spawning, the mother offers its body as food for its children as an extreme case of maternal instinct. The children are fated to repeat that same instinct as they become mothers. One day, Grandmother watched a documentary on these spiders and cursed at Mom. Called her “a spider bitch.” I remember that day. Like a child, Mom locked her door and wept pitifully. </p>
