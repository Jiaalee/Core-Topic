            <p><span class="outline">Viktor&Rolf Haute Couture</span><span class="merge">Spring/Summer 2023 presents a</span><span class="iitalic"> parade of dreamy, <br></span>
            <span class="outline">romantic tulle ballgowns, </span><span class="merge">alluding to the grand tradition and</span><span class="iitalic"> golden days of mid-20th </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">century Haute Couture. T</span><span class="merge">he body is constructed, shoulders</span><span class="iitalic"> are bare, décolletés are</span><br>
            <span class="outline">revealing. The waist is ac</span><span class="merge">centuated and juxtaposed with vo</span><span class="iitalic">luminous mille-feuille </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">skirts in endless layers of</span><span class="merge"> tulle. Bodices are embellished wit</span><span class="iitalic">h sparkling embroidery <br></span>
            <span class="outline">and bows. The pastel colo</span><span class="merge">ur scheme is reminiscent of a pai</span><span class="iitalic"> nting by Boucher or </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">Watteau. With its delicate</span><span class="merge"> atmosphere, the collection appe</span><span class="iitalic">ars to set the tone for an </span><br>
            <span class="outline">almost stereotypical visio</span><span class="merge">n of Haute Couture as an anachro</span><span class="iitalic">nistic dream of  </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">soft femininity.</span><br></p>
            <p><span class="outline">But dreams are deceptive.</span><span class="merge"> The familiar becomes strange, a</span><span class="iitalic">s the mundane </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">transforms into the absur</span><span class="merge">d and vice versa. This collection v</span><span class="iitalic">isualizes the sense of </span><br>
            <span class="outline">alienation the collection ti</span><span class="merge">tle refers to. A singular and narro</span><span class="iitalic">wly defined 'fashion ideal' </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">is presented and artistical</span><span class="merge">ly manipulated to put itself into q</span><span class="iitalic">uestion. The body, while <br></span>
            <span class="outline">retaining the 'dessous' tha</span><span class="merge">t sculpts its silhouette &#40;traditiona</span><span class="iitalic">lly an integrated part of </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">the structure of a Couture</span><span class="merge"> dress&#41;, moves away from the ga</span><span class="iitalic">rment. And the dress, </span><br>
            <span class="outline">while retaining its idealize</span><span class="merge">d shape, antagonizes, alienates a</span><span class="iitalic">nd frees itself from the </span> <br>
            <span class="outline">body in a surreal way.</span></p></div>

            <p><span class="merge">The couture shows—for t</span><span class="outline">hose of us who do't have six figu</span><span class="iitalic">res to spend on an </span> <br>

            <span class="merge">row seat at the one per ce</span><span class="outline">nt's playground can feel practica</span><span class="iitalic">lly vertigo-inducing.<br></span></p>
            <p><span class="merge">Then came along Viktor &</span><span class="outline"> Rolf, who sent out a collection of</span><span class="iitalic"> gowns for their spring </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">couture collection that sk</span><span class="outline">ewered that topsy-turvy feeling—</span><span class="iitalic">and then some. One </span><br>
            <span class="merge">model wore her ball gown</span><span class="outline"> upside down, her vision complet</span><span class="iitalic">ely obscured by an </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">inverted 3-D printed bodi</span><span class="outline">ce and layers of tightly sewn pow</span><span class="iitalic">der-blue tulle &#40;she was <br></span>
            <span class="merge">guided along the runway </span><span class="outline">with instructions delivered over a</span><span class="iitalic">n earpiece&#41;. Others wore </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">pretty pastel creations th</span><span class="outline">at were slightly askew, held by a f</span><span class="iitalic">rame on an angle just off </span><br>
            <span class="merge">their bodies, as though th</span><span class="outline">ey were the result of a photoshop</span><span class="iitalic">ping error. A couple wore </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">their debutante-style dre</span><span class="outline">sses perpendicular to their bodies</span><span class="iitalic">, as though they'd taken <br></span>
            <span class="merge">some red-carpet style tip</span><span class="outline">s from Wednesday Addams. Som</span><span class="iitalic">ehow they kept their faces </span> <br>
            <span class="merge">humorless as they proces</span><span class="outline">sed through the gilded ballroom </span><span class="iitalic">of the Intercontinental </span><br>

            <div class="tt">
            <p><span class="iitalic">The effect was giggle-ind</span><span class="merge">ucing. “It's an absurd take on the </span><span class="merge">stereotype of a couture <br></span>
            <span class="iitalic">ballgown,” said Rolf Snoer</span><span class="merge">en backstage, chuckling softly. “</span><span class="merge">Which we translated for </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">the 21st century,” added </span><span class="merge">Viktor Horsting. Snoeren continue</span><span class="merge">d: “It comes from a love of </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">glamour [but] like our per</span><span class="merge">fume, we want it to be beautiful a</span><span class="merge">nd we also want it to have </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">a clever idea.” The first th</span><span class="merge">ree dresses were classically-con</span><span class="merge">structed, cupcake-shaped <br></span>
            <span class="iitalic">ball gowns, with corset w</span><span class="merge">aists embellished with crystals an</span><span class="merge">d bows and sugary pastel </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">skirts. Then came a mode</span><span class="merge">l in a beige corset, her peach dre</span><span class="merge">ss bobbing along 10cm in </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">front of her, held off her b</span><span class="merge">ody with a hidden frame, and loo</span><span class="merge">king as though it were  </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">being ferried along by the</span><span class="merge"> mice in Cinderella. “We like the id</span><span class="merge">ea to first give the </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">impression of, 'Ahhhhhh, i</span><span class="merge">t's going to be all very lovely.' And</span><span class="merge"> then: Oops!” said </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">Snoeren.</span></p>
            <p><span class="iitalic">There was a comment her</span><span class="merge">e about internet culture and how</span><span class="merge"> consuming visuals on our <br></span>
            <span class="iitalic">phones—snapping photo</span><span class="merge">graphs and immediately being abl</span><span class="merge">e to invert them, using </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">filters to distort and enha</span><span class="merge">nce our silhouettes and bone stru</span><span class="merge">cture—has warped our </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">sense of reality. “There is </span><span class="merge">a disconnect between what we s</span><span class="merge">ee, and the physicality of </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">the product,” said Snoere</span><span class="merge">n. Then there is the internet's con</span><span class="merge">text-less state, where one </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">scroll can take you from a</span><span class="merge"> fashion show to a mass shooting</span><span class="merge">. “The information that </span><br>
            <span class="iitalic">comes at us, going from m</span><span class="merge">aking banana cake to so many p</span><span class="merge">eople being killed in </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">Ukraine,” said Snoeren. “It'</span><span class="merge">s: What kind of world are we livin</span><span class="merge">g in? It's absurd,” said <br></span>
            <span class="iitalic">Horsting. Luckily, the duo </span><span class="merge">found some fun in the incongruity. </span><span class="merge">As a viral moment that </span> <br>
            <span class="iitalic">wasn't shot through with </span><span class="merge">controversy, it was a masterclass.</span></p></div>
